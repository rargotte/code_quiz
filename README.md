If you want to add more questions and answer is very easy:

1. In the script.js file add a new "quizx" object. Just copy the first one and change the number of the question. In this case we are adding question number 5:

var quiz5 = {
    question: "What is the name of this application?",
    answers: {
        answer1: "1. code_quiz",
        answer2: "2. quiz_code",
        answer3: "3. code_code"
    },

        correctAnswer: "b_1",

};

2. And then add the new object in the array of questions:

var quiz = [quiz1, quiz2, quiz3, quiz4, quiz5];

3. The new question should be displayed next time you run the application.
